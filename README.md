Endless Tunes was created as proof of concept to show an iOS application which could combine multiple music streaming services into one. Endless Tunes allows a user to search multiple music catalogs simultaneously to quickly find music they're looking for. 

### Main Features

- **Create Cross-Service Playlists: Create custom playlists which pull the best content from every service. No More switching between applications
- **Create Parties: Start a virtual party and DJ for others, while they listen along on their iOS App. You pick the tunes while they listen along. Alternatively, make the party collaborative and allow others to contribute to the endless tunes
- **Social: Follow others so you can join their parties, as well as see their custom cross-service playlist creations.
